        Contracts define a customer's products, pricing, discounts, access duration, and
        billing configuration. Contracts serve as the central billing agreement for both
        PLG and Enterprise customers, you can automatically customers access to your
        products and services directly from your product or CRM.

        ### Use this endpoint to:

        - PLG onboarding: Automatically provision new self-serve customers with
          contracts when they sign up.
        - Enterprise sales: Push negotiated contracts from Salesforce with custom
          pricing and commitments
        - Promotional pricing: Implement time-limited discounts and free trials through
          overrides

        ### Key components:

        #### Contract Term and Billing Schedule

        - Set contract duration using `starting_at` and `ending_before` fields. PLG
          contracts typically use perpetual agreements (no end date), while Enterprise
          contracts have fixed end dates which can be edited over time in the case of
          co-term upsells.

        #### Rate Card

        If you are offering usage based pricing, you can set a rate card for the
        contract to reference through `rate_card_id` or `rate_card_alias`. The rate card
        is a store of all of your usage based products and their centralized pricing.
        Any new products or price changes on the rate card can be set to automatically
        propagate to all associated contracts - this ensures consistent pricing and
        product launches flow to contracts without manual updates and migrations. The
        `usage_statement_schedule` determines the cadence on which Metronome will
        finalize a usage invoice for the customer. This defaults to monthly on the 1st,
        with options for custom dates, quarterly, or annual cadences. Note: Most usage
        based billing companies align usage statements to be evaluated aligned to the
        first of the month. Read more about
        [Rate Cards](https://docs.metronome.com/pricing-packaging/create-manage-rate-cards/).

        #### Overrides and discounts

        Customize pricing on the contract through time-bounded overrides that can target
        specific products, product families, or complex usage scenarios. Overrides
        enable two key capabilities:

        - Discounts: Apply percentage discounts, fixed rate reductions, or
          quantity-based pricing tiers
        - Entitlements: Provide special pricing or access to specific products for
          negotiated deals

        Read more about
        [Contract Overrides](https://docs.metronome.com/manage-product-access/add-contract-override/).

        #### Commits and Credits

        Using commits, configure prepaid or postpaid spending commitments where
        customers promise to spend a certain amount over the contract period paid in
        advance or in arrears. Use credits to provide free spending allowances. Under
        the hood these are the same mechanisms, however, credits are typically offered
        for free (SLA or promotional) or as a part of an allotment associated with a
        Subscription.

        In Metronome, you can set commits and credits to only be applicable for a subset
        of usage. Use `applicable_product_ids` or `applicable_product_tags` to create
        product or product-family specific commits or credits, or you can build complex
        boolean logic specifiers to target usage based on pricing and presentation group
        values using `override_specifiers`.

        These objects can also also be configured to have a recurrence schedule to
        easily model customer packaging which includes recurring monthly or quarterly
        allotments.

        Commits support rollover settings (`rollover_fraction`) to transfer unused
        balances between contract periods, either entirely or as a percentage.

        Read more about
        [Credits and Commits](https://docs.metronome.com/pricing-packaging/apply-credits-commits/).

        #### Subscriptions

        You can add a fixed recurring charge to a contract, like monthly licenses or
        seat-based fees, using the subscription charge. Subscription charges are defined
        on your rate card and you can select which subscription is applicable to add to
        each contract. When you add a subscription to a contract you need to:

        - Define whether the subscription is paid for in-advance or in-arrears
          (`collection_schedule`)
        - Define the proration behavior (`proration`)
        - Specify an initial quantity (`initial_quantity`)
        - Define which subscription rate on the rate card should be used
          (`subscription_rate`)

        Read more about
        [Subscriptions](https://docs.metronome.com/manage-product-access/create-subscription/).

        #### Scheduled Charges

        Set up one-time, recurring, or entirely custom charges that occur on specific
        dates, separate from usage-based billing or commitments. These can be used to
        model non-recurring platform charges or professional services.

        #### Threshold Billing

        Metronome allows you to configure automatic billing triggers when customers
        reach spending thresholds to prevent fraud and manage risk. You can use
        `spend_threshold_configuration` to trigger an invoice to cover current charges
        whenever the threshold is reached or you can ensure the customer maintains a
        minimum prepaid balance using the `prepaid_balance_configuration`.

        Read more about
        [Spend Threshold](https://docs.metronome.com/manage-product-access/spend-thresholds/)
        and
        [Prepaid Balance Thresholds](https://docs.metronome.com/manage-product-access/prepaid-balance-thresholds/).

        ### Usage guidelines:

        - You can always
          [Edit Contracts](https://docs.metronome.com/manage-product-access/edit-contract/)
          after it has been created, using the `editContract` endpoint. Metronome keeps
          track of all edits, both in the audit log and over the `getEditHistory`
          endpoint.
        - Customers in Metronome can have multiple concurrent contracts at one time. Use
          `usage_filters` to route the correct usage to each contract.
          [Read more about usage filters](https://docs.metronome.com/manage-product-access/provision-customer/#create-a-usage-filter).

        Args:
          starting_at: inclusive contract start time

          billing_provider_configuration: The billing provider configuration associated with a contract. Provide either an
              ID or the provider and delivery method.

          custom_fields: Custom fields to be added eg. { "key1": "value1", "key2": "value2" }

          discounts: This field's availability is dependent on your client's configuration.

          ending_before: exclusive contract end time

          multiplier_override_prioritization: Defaults to LOWEST_MULTIPLIER, which applies the greatest discount to list
              prices automatically. EXPLICIT prioritization requires specifying priorities for
              each multiplier; the one with the lowest priority value will be prioritized
              first. If tiered overrides are used, prioritization must be explicit.

          netsuite_sales_order_id: This field's availability is dependent on your client's configuration.

          priority: Priority of the contract.

          professional_services: This field's availability is dependent on your client's configuration.

          rate_card_alias: Selects the rate card linked to the specified alias as of the contract's start
              date.

          reseller_royalties: This field's availability is dependent on your client's configuration.

          salesforce_opportunity_id: This field's availability is dependent on your client's configuration.

          scheduled_charges_on_usage_invoices: Determines which scheduled and commit charges to consolidate onto the Contract's
              usage invoice. The charge's `timestamp` must match the usage invoice's
              `ending_before` date for consolidation to occur. This field cannot be modified
              after a Contract has been created. If this field is omitted, charges will appear
              on a separate invoice from usage charges.

          subscriptions: Optional list of
              [subscriptions](https://docs.metronome.com/manage-product-access/create-subscription/)
              to add to the contract.

          total_contract_value: This field's availability is dependent on your client's configuration.

          uniqueness_key: Prevents the creation of duplicates. If a request to create a record is made
              with a previously used uniqueness key, a new record will not be created and the
              request will fail with a 409 error.

        Manual ledger entries can be extremely useful for resolving discrepancies in
        Metronome. However, most corrections to inaccurate billings can be modified
        upstream of the commit, whether that is via contract editing, rate editing, or

        #### Impact on commits and credits:

        When archiving a contract, all associated commits and credits are also archived.
        For prepaid commits with active segments, Metronome automatically generates
        expiration ledger entries to close out any remaining balances, ensuring accurate
        accounting of unused prepaid amounts. These ledger entries will appear in the
        commit's transaction history with type `PREPAID_COMMIT_EXPIRATION`.

        #### Archived contract visibility:

        Archived contracts remain accessible for historical reporting and audit
        purposes. They can be retrieved using the `ListContracts` endpoint by setting
        the `include_archived` parameter to `true` or in the Metronome UI when the "Show

        Contracts define a customer's products, pricing, discounts, access duration, and
        billing configuration. Contracts serve as the central billing agreement for both
        PLG and Enterprise customers, you can automatically customers access to your
        products and services directly from your product or CRM.

        ### Use this endpoint to:

        - PLG onboarding: Automatically provision new self-serve customers with
          contracts when they sign up.
        - Enterprise sales: Push negotiated contracts from Salesforce with custom
          pricing and commitments
        - Promotional pricing: Implement time-limited discounts and free trials through
          overrides

        ### Key components:

        #### Contract Term and Billing Schedule

        - Set contract duration using `starting_at` and `ending_before` fields. PLG
          contracts typically use perpetual agreements (no end date), while Enterprise
          contracts have fixed end dates which can be edited over time in the case of
          co-term upsells.

        #### Rate Card

        If you are offering usage based pricing, you can set a rate card for the
        contract to reference through `rate_card_id` or `rate_card_alias`. The rate card
        is a store of all of your usage based products and their centralized pricing.
        Any new products or price changes on the rate card can be set to automatically
        propagate to all associated contracts - this ensures consistent pricing and
        product launches flow to contracts without manual updates and migrations. The
        `usage_statement_schedule` determines the cadence on which Metronome will
        finalize a usage invoice for the customer. This defaults to monthly on the 1st,
        with options for custom dates, quarterly, or annual cadences. Note: Most usage
        based billing companies align usage statements to be evaluated aligned to the
        first of the month. Read more about
        [Rate Cards](https://docs.metronome.com/pricing-packaging/create-manage-rate-cards/).

        #### Overrides and discounts

        Customize pricing on the contract through time-bounded overrides that can target
        specific products, product families, or complex usage scenarios. Overrides
        enable two key capabilities:

        - Discounts: Apply percentage discounts, fixed rate reductions, or
          quantity-based pricing tiers
        - Entitlements: Provide special pricing or access to specific products for
          negotiated deals

        Read more about
        [Contract Overrides](https://docs.metronome.com/manage-product-access/add-contract-override/).

        #### Commits and Credits

        Using commits, configure prepaid or postpaid spending commitments where
        customers promise to spend a certain amount over the contract period paid in
        advance or in arrears. Use credits to provide free spending allowances. Under
        the hood these are the same mechanisms, however, credits are typically offered
        for free (SLA or promotional) or as a part of an allotment associated with a
        Subscription.

        In Metronome, you can set commits and credits to only be applicable for a subset
        of usage. Use `applicable_product_ids` or `applicable_product_tags` to create
        product or product-family specific commits or credits, or you can build complex
        boolean logic specifiers to target usage based on pricing and presentation group
        values using `override_specifiers`.

        These objects can also also be configured to have a recurrence schedule to
        easily model customer packaging which includes recurring monthly or quarterly
        allotments.

        Commits support rollover settings (`rollover_fraction`) to transfer unused
        balances between contract periods, either entirely or as a percentage.

        Read more about
        [Credits and Commits](https://docs.metronome.com/pricing-packaging/apply-credits-commits/).

        #### Subscriptions

        You can add a fixed recurring charge to a contract, like monthly licenses or
        seat-based fees, using the subscription charge. Subscription charges are defined
        on your rate card and you can select which subscription is applicable to add to
        each contract. When you add a subscription to a contract you need to:

        - Define whether the subscription is paid for in-advance or in-arrears
          (`collection_schedule`)
        - Define the proration behavior (`proration`)
        - Specify an initial quantity (`initial_quantity`)
        - Define which subscription rate on the rate card should be used
          (`subscription_rate`)

        [Subscriptions](https://docs.metronome.com/manage-product-access/create-subscription/).

        #### Scheduled Charges

        Set up one-time, recurring, or entirely custom charges that occur on specific
        dates, separate from usage-based billing or commitments. These can be used to
        model non-recurring platform charges or professional services.

        #### Threshold Billing

        Metronome allows you to configure automatic billing triggers when customers
        reach spending thresholds to prevent fraud and manage risk. You can use
        `spend_threshold_configuration` to trigger an invoice to cover current charges
        whenever the threshold is reached or you can ensure the customer maintains a
        minimum prepaid balance using the `prepaid_balance_configuration`.

        Read more about
        [Spend Threshold](https://docs.metronome.com/manage-product-access/spend-thresholds/)
        and
        [Prepaid Balance Thresholds](https://docs.metronome.com/manage-product-access/prepaid-balance-thresholds/).

        ### Usage guidelines:

        - You can always
          [Edit Contracts](https://docs.metronome.com/manage-product-access/edit-contract/)
          after it has been created, using the `editContract` endpoint. Metronome keeps
          track of all edits, both in the audit log and over the `getEditHistory`
          endpoint.
        - Customers in Metronome can have multiple concurrent contracts at one time. Use
          `usage_filters` to route the correct usage to each contract.
          [Read more about usage filters](https://docs.metronome.com/manage-product-access/provision-customer/#create-a-usage-filter).

        Args:
          starting_at: inclusive contract start time

          billing_provider_configuration: The billing provider configuration associated with a contract. Provide either an
              ID or the provider and delivery method.

          custom_fields: Custom fields to be added eg. { "key1": "value1", "key2": "value2" }

          discounts: This field's availability is dependent on your client's configuration.

          ending_before: exclusive contract end time

          multiplier_override_prioritization: Defaults to LOWEST_MULTIPLIER, which applies the greatest discount to list
              prices automatically. EXPLICIT prioritization requires specifying priorities for
              each multiplier; the one with the lowest priority value will be prioritized
              first. If tiered overrides are used, prioritization must be explicit.

          netsuite_sales_order_id: This field's availability is dependent on your client's configuration.

          priority: Priority of the contract.

          professional_services: This field's availability is dependent on your client's configuration.

          rate_card_alias: Selects the rate card linked to the specified alias as of the contract's start
              date.

          reseller_royalties: This field's availability is dependent on your client's configuration.

          salesforce_opportunity_id: This field's availability is dependent on your client's configuration.

          scheduled_charges_on_usage_invoices: Determines which scheduled and commit charges to consolidate onto the Contract's
              usage invoice. The charge's `timestamp` must match the usage invoice's
              `ending_before` date for consolidation to occur. This field cannot be modified
              after a Contract has been created. If this field is omitted, charges will appear
              on a separate invoice from usage charges.

          subscriptions: Optional list of
              [subscriptions](https://docs.metronome.com/manage-product-access/create-subscription/)
              to add to the contract.

          total_contract_value: This field's availability is dependent on your client's configuration.

          uniqueness_key: Prevents the creation of duplicates. If a request to create a record is made
              with a previously used uniqueness key, a new record will not be created and the
              request will fail with a 409 error.

        event a contract was incorrectly created and needed to be removed from a
        customer.

        #### Impact on commits and credits:

        When archiving a contract, all associated commits and credits are also archived.
        For prepaid commits with active segments, Metronome automatically generates
        expiration ledger entries to close out any remaining balances, ensuring accurate
        accounting of unused prepaid amounts. These ledger entries will appear in the
        commit's transaction history with type `PREPAID_COMMIT_EXPIRATION`.

        #### Archived contract visibility:

        Archived contracts remain accessible for historical reporting and audit
        purposes. They can be retrieved using the `ListContracts` endpoint by setting
        the `include_archived` parameter to `true` or in the Metronome UI when the "Show
        archived" option is enabled.

        postpaid commitments, promotional credits, and other balance types that can
        offset usage charges, helping you build transparent billing experiences.

        ### Use this endpoint to:

        - Display current available balances in customer dashboards
        - Verify available funds before approving high-usage operations
        - Generate balance reports for finance teams
        - Filter balances by contract or date ranges

        ### Key response fields:

        An array of balance objects (all credits and commits) containing:

        - Balance details: Current available amount for each commit or credit
        - Metadata: Product associations, priorities, applicable date ranges
        - Optional ledger entries: Detailed transaction history (if

        ### Usage guidelines:

        - Date filtering: Use `effective_before` to include only balances with access
          before a specific date (exclusive)
        - Set `include_balance=true` for calculated balance amounts on each commit or
          credit
        - Set `include_ledgers=true` for full transaction history
        - Set `include_contract_balances = true` to see contract level balances
        - Balance logic: Reflects currently accessible amounts, excluding expired/future
          segments

              slower.

          limit: The maximum number of commits to return. Defaults to 25.

          next_page: The next page token from a previous response.

        Ending a contract early will impact
        draft usage statements, truncate any terms, and remove upcoming scheduled
        invoices. Moving the date into the future will only extend the contract length.
        Terms and scheduled invoices are not extended. Use this if a contract's end date
        has changed or if a perpetual contract ends.

        Args:
          contract_id: ID of the contract to update

          customer_id: ID of the customer whose contract is to be updated

          allow_ending_before_finalized_invoice: If true, allows setting the contract end date earlier than the end_timestamp of
              existing finalized invoices. Finalized invoices will be unchanged; if you want
              to incorporate the new end date, you can void and regenerate finalized usage
              invoices. Defaults to true.

          ending_before: RFC 3339 timestamp indicating when the contract will end (exclusive). If not
              provided, the contract will be updated to be open-ended.
