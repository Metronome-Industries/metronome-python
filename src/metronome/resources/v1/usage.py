        The ingest endpoint is the primary method for sending usage events to Metronome,
        serving as the foundation for all billing calculations in your usage-based
        pricing model. This high-throughput endpoint is designed for real-time streaming
        ingestion, supports backdating 34 days, and is built to handle mission-critical
        usage data with enterprise-grade reliability. Metronome supports 100,000 events
        per second without requiring pre-aggregation or rollups and can scale up from
        there. See
        [Getting usage into Metronome](https://docs.metronome.com/connect-metronome/) to
        learn more about usage events.

        ### Use this endpoint to:

        Create a customer usage pipeline into Metronome that drives billable metrics,
        credit drawdown, and invoicing. Track customer behavior, resource consumption,
        and feature usage

        ### What happens when you send events:

        - Events are validated and processed in real-time
        - Events are matched to customers using customer IDs or customer ingest aliases
        - Events are matched to billable metrics and are immediately available for usage
          and spend calculations

        ### Usage guidelines:

        - Historical events can be backdated up to 34 days and will immediately impact
          live customer spend
        - Duplicate events are automatically detected and ignored (34-day deduplication
          window)

        #### Event structure:

        Usage events are simple JSON objects designed for flexibility and ease of
        integration:

        ```json
        {
          "transaction_id": "2021-01-01T00:00:00Z_cluster42",
          "customer_id": "team@example.com",
          "event_type": "api_request",
          "timestamp": "2021-01-01T00:00:00Z",
          "properties": {
            "endpoint": "/v1/users",
            "method": "POST",
            "response_time_ms": 45,
            "region": "us-west-2"
          }
        }
        ```

        #### Transaction ID

        The transaction_id serves as your idempotency key, ensuring events are processed
        exactly once. Metronome maintains a 34-day deduplication window - significantly
        longer than typical 12-hour windows - enabling robust backfill scenarios without
        duplicate billing.

        - Best Practices:
          - Use UUIDs for one-time events: uuid4()
          - For heartbeat events, use deterministic IDs
          - Include enough context to avoid collisions across different event sources

        #### Customer ID

        Identifies which customer should be billed for this usage. Supports two
        identification methods:

        - Metronome Customer ID: The UUID returned when creating a customer
        - Ingest Alias: Your system's identifier (email, account number, etc.)

        Ingest aliases enable seamless integration without requiring ID mapping, and
        customers can have multiple aliases for flexibility.

        #### Event Type:

        Categorizes the event type for billable metric matching. Choose descriptive
        names that aligns with the product surface area.

        #### Properties:

        Flexible metadata also used to match billable metrics or to be used to serve as
        group keys to create multiple pricing dimensions or breakdown costs by novel
        properties for end customers or internal finance teams measuring underlying
        COGs.

        This endpoint retrieves events by transaction ID for events that occurred within
        the last 34 days. It is specifically designed for sampling-based testing
        workflows to detect revenue leakage. The Event Search API provides a critical
        observability tool that validates the integrity of your usage pipeline by
        allowing you to sample raw events and verify their matching against active
        billable metrics.

        Why event observability matters for revenue leakage: Silent revenue loss occurs
        when events are dropped, delayed, or fail to match billable metrics due to:

        - Upstream system failures
        - Event format changes
        - Misconfigured billable metrics

        ### Use this endpoint to:

        - Sample raw events and validate they match the expected billable metrics
        - Build custom leakage detection alerts to prevent silent revenue loss
        - Verify event processing accuracy during system changes or metric updates
        - Debug event matching issues in real-time

        ### Key response fields:

        - Complete event details including transaction ID, customer ID, and properties
        - Matched Metronome customer (if any)
        - Matched billable metric information (if any)
        - Processing status and duplicate detection flags

        ### Usage guidelines:

        ⚠️ Important: This endpoint is heavily rate limited and designed for sampling
        workflows only. Do not use this endpoint to check every event in your system.
        Instead, implement a sampling strategy to randomly validate a subset of events

        - `customer_id`: The customer this usage belongs to
        - `billable_metric_id` and `billable_metric_name`: What was measured
        - `start_timestamp` and `end_timestamp`: Time window for this data point
        - `value`: Aggregated usage amount for the period
        - `groups` (optional): Usage broken down by group keys with values
        - `next_page`: Pagination cursor for large result sets

        ### Usage guidelines:

        - Time windows: Set `window_size` to `hour`, `day`, or `none` (entire period)
        - Required parameters: Must specify `starting_on`, `ending_before`, and
          `window_size`
        - Filtering options:
          - `customer_ids`: Limit to specific customers (omit for all customers)
          - `billable_metrics`: Limit to specific metrics (omit for all metrics)
        - Pagination: Use `next_page` cursor to retrieve large datasets
        - Null values: Group values may be null when no usage matches that group

        Args:
          window_size: A window_size of "day" or "hour" will return the usage for the specified period
              segmented into daily or hourly aggregates. A window_size of "none" will return a
              single usage aggregate for the entirety of the specified period.

          next_page: Cursor that indicates where the next page of results should start.

          billable_metrics: A list of billable metrics to fetch usage for. If absent, all billable metrics
              will be returned.

          customer_ids: A list of Metronome customer IDs to fetch usage for. If absent, usage for all
              customers will be returned.

        The ingest endpoint is the primary method for sending usage events to Metronome,
        serving as the foundation for all billing calculations in your usage-based
        pricing model. This high-throughput endpoint is designed for real-time streaming
        ingestion, supports backdating 34 days, and is built to handle mission-critical
        usage data with enterprise-grade reliability. Metronome supports 100,000 events
        per second without requiring pre-aggregation or rollups and can scale up from
        there. See
        [Getting usage into Metronome](https://docs.metronome.com/connect-metronome/) to
        learn more about usage events.

        ### Use this endpoint to:

        Create a customer usage pipeline into Metronome that drives billable metrics,
        credit drawdown, and invoicing. Track customer behavior, resource consumption,
        and feature usage

        ### What happens when you send events:

        - Events are validated and processed in real-time
        - Events are matched to customers using customer IDs or customer ingest aliases
        - Events are matched to billable metrics and are immediately available for usage
          and spend calculations

        ### Usage guidelines:

        - Historical events can be backdated up to 34 days and will immediately impact
          live customer spend
        - Duplicate events are automatically detected and ignored (34-day deduplication
          window)

        #### Event structure:

        Usage events are simple JSON objects designed for flexibility and ease of
        integration:

        ```json
        {
          "transaction_id": "2021-01-01T00:00:00Z_cluster42",
          "customer_id": "team@example.com",
          "event_type": "api_request",
          "timestamp": "2021-01-01T00:00:00Z",
          "properties": {
            "endpoint": "/v1/users",
            "method": "POST",
            "response_time_ms": 45,
            "region": "us-west-2"
          }
        }
        ```

        #### Transaction ID

        The transaction_id serves as your idempotency key, ensuring events are processed
        exactly once. Metronome maintains a 34-day deduplication window - significantly
        longer than typical 12-hour windows - enabling robust backfill scenarios without
        duplicate billing.

        - Best Practices:
          - Use UUIDs for one-time events: uuid4()
          - For heartbeat events, use deterministic IDs
          - Include enough context to avoid collisions across different event sources

        #### Customer ID

        Identifies which customer should be billed for this usage. Supports two
        identification methods:

        - Metronome Customer ID: The UUID returned when creating a customer
        - Ingest Alias: Your system's identifier (email, account number, etc.)

        Ingest aliases enable seamless integration without requiring ID mapping, and
        customers can have multiple aliases for flexibility.

        #### Event Type:

        Categorizes the event type for billable metric matching. Choose descriptive
        names that aligns with the product surface area.

        #### Properties:

        Flexible metadata also used to match billable metrics or to be used to serve as
        group keys to create multiple pricing dimensions or breakdown costs by novel
        properties for end customers or internal finance teams measuring underlying
        COGs.

        This endpoint retrieves events by transaction ID for events that occurred within
        the last 34 days. It is specifically designed for sampling-based testing
        workflows to detect revenue leakage. The Event Search API provides a critical
        observability tool that validates the integrity of your usage pipeline by
        allowing you to sample raw events and verify their matching against active
        billable metrics.

        Why event observability matters for revenue leakage: Silent revenue loss occurs
        when events are dropped, delayed, or fail to match billable metrics due to:

        - Upstream system failures
        - Event format changes
        - Misconfigured billable metrics

        ### Use this endpoint to:

        - Sample raw events and validate they match the expected billable metrics
        - Build custom leakage detection alerts to prevent silent revenue loss
        - Verify event processing accuracy during system changes or metric updates
        - Debug event matching issues in real-time

        ### Key response fields:

        - Complete event details including transaction ID, customer ID, and properties
        - Matched Metronome customer (if any)
        - Matched billable metric information (if any)
        - Processing status and duplicate detection flags

        ### Usage guidelines:

        ⚠️ Important: This endpoint is heavily rate limited and designed for sampling
        workflows only. Do not use this endpoint to check every event in your system.
        Instead, implement a sampling strategy to randomly validate a subset of events
        for observability purposes.
