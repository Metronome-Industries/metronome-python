        Creates customer-level commits that establish spending commitments for customers
        across their Metronome usage. Commits represent contracted spending obligations
        that can be either prepaid (paid upfront) or postpaid (billed later).

        Note: In most cases, you should add commitments directly to customer contracts
        using the contract/create or contract/edit APIs.

        ### Use this endpoint to:

        Use this endpoint when you need to establish customer-level spending commitments
        that can be applied across multiple contracts or scoped to specific contracts.
        Customer-level commits are ideal for:

        - Enterprise-wide minimum spending agreements that span multiple contracts
        - Multi-contract volume commitments with shared spending pools
        - Cross-contract discount tiers based on aggregate usage

        #### Commit type Requirements:

        - You must specify either "prepaid" or "postpaid" as the commit type:
        - Prepaid commits: Customer pays upfront; invoice_schedule is optional (if
          omitted, creates a commit without an invoice)
        - Postpaid commits: Customer pays when the commitment expires (the end of the
          access_schedule); invoice_schedule is required and must match access_schedule
          totals.

        #### Billing configuration:

        - invoice_contract_id is required for postpaid commits and for prepaid commits
          with billing (only optional for free prepaid commits)
        - For postpaid commits: access_schedule and invoice_schedule must have matching
          amounts
        - For postpaid commits: only one schedule item is allowed in both schedules.

        #### Scoping flexibility:

        Customer-level commits can be configured in a few ways:

        - Contract-specific: Use the `applicable_contract_ids` field to limit the commit
          to specific contracts
        - Cross-contract: Leave `applicable_contract_ids` empty to allow the commit to
          be used across all of the customer's contracts

        #### Product targeting:

        Commits can be scoped to specific products using applicable_product_ids,
        applicable_product_tags, or specifiers, or left unrestricted to apply to all
        products.

        #### Priority considerations:

        When multiple commits are applicable, the one with the lower priority value will
        be consumed first. If there is a tie, contract level commits and credits will be
        applied before customer level commits and credits. Plan your priority scheme
        carefully to ensure commits are applied in the desired order.

        ### Usage guidelines:

        ⚠️ Preferred Alternative: In most cases, you should add commits directly to
        contracts using the create contract or edit contract APIs instead of creating
        customer-level commits. Contract-level commits provide better organization and
        are the recommended approach for standard use cases.

        Args:
          access_schedule: Schedule for distributing the commit to the customer. For "POSTPAID" commits
              only one schedule item is allowed and amount must match invoice_schedule total.

          priority: If multiple credits or commits are applicable, the one with the lower priority
              will apply first.

          product_id: ID of the fixed product associated with the commit. This is required because
              products are used to invoice the commit amount.

          applicable_contract_ids: Which contract the commit applies to. If not provided, the commit applies to all
              contracts.

          applicable_product_ids: Which products the commit applies to. If applicable_product_ids,
              applicable_product_tags or specifiers are not provided, the commit applies to
              all products.

          applicable_product_tags: Which tags the commit applies to. If applicable_product_ids,
              applicable_product_tags or specifiers are not provided, the commit applies to
              all products.

          custom_fields: Custom fields to be added eg. { "key1": "value1", "key2": "value2" }

          description: Used only in UI/API. It is not exposed to end customers.

          invoice_contract_id: The contract that this commit will be billed on. This is required for "POSTPAID"
              commits and for "PREPAID" commits unless there is no invoice schedule above
              (i.e., the commit is 'free').

          invoice_schedule: Required for "POSTPAID" commits: the true up invoice will be generated at this
              time and only one schedule item is allowed; the total must match
              accesss_schedule amount. Optional for "PREPAID" commits: if not provided, this
              will be a "complimentary" commit with no invoice.

          name: displayed on invoices

          netsuite_sales_order_id: This field's availability is dependent on your client's configuration.

          salesforce_opportunity_id: This field's availability is dependent on your client's configuration.

          specifiers: List of filters that determine what kind of customer usage draws down a commit
              or credit. A customer's usage needs to meet the condition of at least one of the
              specifiers to contribute to a commit's or credit's drawdown. This field cannot
              be used together with `applicable_product_ids` or `applicable_product_tags`.

          uniqueness_key: Prevents the creation of duplicates. If a request to create a commit or credit
              is made with a uniqueness key that was previously used to create a commit or
              credit, a new record will not be created and the request will fail with a 409
              error.

          extra_query: Add additional query parameters to the request

        Retrieve all commit agreements for a customer, including both prepaid and
        postpaid commitments. This endpoint provides comprehensive visibility into
        contractual spending obligations, enabling you to track commitment utilization
        and manage customer contracts effectively.

        ### Use this endpoint to:

        - Display commitment balances and utilization in customer dashboards
        - Track prepaid commitment drawdown and remaining balances
        - Monitor postpaid commitment progress toward minimum thresholds
        - Build commitment tracking and forecasting tools
        - Show commitment history with optional ledger details
        - Manage rollover balances between contract periods

        ### Key response fields:

        An array of Commit objects containing:

        - Commit type: PREPAID (pay upfront) or POSTPAID (pay at true-up)
        - Rate type: COMMIT_RATE (discounted) or LIST_RATE (standard pricing)
        - Access schedule: When commitment funds become available
        - Invoice schedule: When the customer is billed
        - Product targeting: Which product(s) usage is eligible to draw from this commit
        - Optional ledger entries: Transaction history (if `include_ledgers=true`)
        - Balance information: Current available amount (if `include_balance=true`)
        - Rollover settings: Fraction of unused amount that carries forward

        ### Usage guidelines:

        - Pagination: Results limited to 25 commits per page; use 'next_page' for more
        - Date filtering options:
          - `covering_date`: Commits active on a specific date
          - `starting_at`: Commits with access on/after a date
          - `effective_before`: Commits with access before a date (exclusive)

            customer-level)
          - `include_archived`: Include archived commits and commits from archived
            contracts
        - Performance considerations:
          - include_ledgers: Adds detailed transaction history (slower)
          - include_balance: Adds current balance calculation (slower)
        - Optional filtering: Use commit_id to retrieve a specific commit

        Args:
          covering_date: Include only commits that have access schedules that "cover" the provided date

        Creates customer-level commits that establish spending commitments for customers
        across their Metronome usage. Commits represent contracted spending obligations
        that can be either prepaid (paid upfront) or postpaid (billed later).

        Note: In most cases, you should add commitments directly to customer contracts
        using the contract/create or contract/edit APIs.

        ### Use this endpoint to:

        Use this endpoint when you need to establish customer-level spending commitments
        that can be applied across multiple contracts or scoped to specific contracts.
        Customer-level commits are ideal for:

        - Enterprise-wide minimum spending agreements that span multiple contracts
        - Multi-contract volume commitments with shared spending pools
        - Cross-contract discount tiers based on aggregate usage

        #### Commit type Requirements:

        - You must specify either "prepaid" or "postpaid" as the commit type:
        - Prepaid commits: Customer pays upfront; invoice_schedule is optional (if
          omitted, creates a commit without an invoice)
        - Postpaid commits: Customer pays when the commitment expires (the end of the
          access_schedule); invoice_schedule is required and must match access_schedule
          totals.

        #### Billing configuration:

        - invoice_contract_id is required for postpaid commits and for prepaid commits
          with billing (only optional for free prepaid commits)
        - For postpaid commits: access_schedule and invoice_schedule must have matching
          amounts
        - For postpaid commits: only one schedule item is allowed in both schedules.

        #### Scoping flexibility:

        Customer-level commits can be configured in a few ways:

        - Contract-specific: Use the `applicable_contract_ids` field to limit the commit
          to specific contracts
        - Cross-contract: Leave `applicable_contract_ids` empty to allow the commit to
          be used across all of the customer's contracts

        #### Product targeting:

        Commits can be scoped to specific products using applicable_product_ids,
        applicable_product_tags, or specifiers, or left unrestricted to apply to all
        products.

        #### Priority considerations:

        When multiple commits are applicable, the one with the lower priority value will
        be consumed first. If there is a tie, contract level commits and credits will be
        applied before customer level commits and credits. Plan your priority scheme
        carefully to ensure commits are applied in the desired order.

        ### Usage guidelines:

        ⚠️ Preferred Alternative: In most cases, you should add commits directly to
        contracts using the create contract or edit contract APIs instead of creating
        customer-level commits. Contract-level commits provide better organization and
        are the recommended approach for standard use cases.

        Args:
          access_schedule: Schedule for distributing the commit to the customer. For "POSTPAID" commits
              only one schedule item is allowed and amount must match invoice_schedule total.

          priority: If multiple credits or commits are applicable, the one with the lower priority
              will apply first.

          product_id: ID of the fixed product associated with the commit. This is required because
              products are used to invoice the commit amount.

          applicable_contract_ids: Which contract the commit applies to. If not provided, the commit applies to all
              contracts.

          applicable_product_ids: Which products the commit applies to. If applicable_product_ids,
              applicable_product_tags or specifiers are not provided, the commit applies to
              all products.

          applicable_product_tags: Which tags the commit applies to. If applicable_product_ids,
              applicable_product_tags or specifiers are not provided, the commit applies to
              all products.

          custom_fields: Custom fields to be added eg. { "key1": "value1", "key2": "value2" }

          description: Used only in UI/API. It is not exposed to end customers.

          invoice_contract_id: The contract that this commit will be billed on. This is required for "POSTPAID"
              commits and for "PREPAID" commits unless there is no invoice schedule above
              (i.e., the commit is 'free').

          invoice_schedule: Required for "POSTPAID" commits: the true up invoice will be generated at this
              time and only one schedule item is allowed; the total must match
              accesss_schedule amount. Optional for "PREPAID" commits: if not provided, this
              will be a "complimentary" commit with no invoice.

          name: displayed on invoices

          netsuite_sales_order_id: This field's availability is dependent on your client's configuration.

          salesforce_opportunity_id: This field's availability is dependent on your client's configuration.

          specifiers: List of filters that determine what kind of customer usage draws down a commit
              or credit. A customer's usage needs to meet the condition of at least one of the
              specifiers to contribute to a commit's or credit's drawdown. This field cannot
              be used together with `applicable_product_ids` or `applicable_product_tags`.

          uniqueness_key: Prevents the creation of duplicates. If a request to create a commit or credit
              is made with a uniqueness key that was previously used to create a commit or
              credit, a new record will not be created and the request will fail with a 409
              error.

        Retrieve all commit agreements for a customer, including both prepaid and
        postpaid commitments. This endpoint provides comprehensive visibility into
        contractual spending obligations, enabling you to track commitment utilization
        and manage customer contracts effectively.

        ### Use this endpoint to:

        - Display commitment balances and utilization in customer dashboards
        - Track prepaid commitment drawdown and remaining balances
        - Monitor postpaid commitment progress toward minimum thresholds
        - Build commitment tracking and forecasting tools
        - Show commitment history with optional ledger details
        - Manage rollover balances between contract periods

        ### Key response fields:

        An array of Commit objects containing:

        - Commit type: PREPAID (pay upfront) or POSTPAID (pay at true-up)
        - Rate type: COMMIT_RATE (discounted) or LIST_RATE (standard pricing)
        - Access schedule: When commitment funds become available
        - Invoice schedule: When the customer is billed
        - Product targeting: Which product(s) usage is eligible to draw from this commit
        - Optional ledger entries: Transaction history (if `include_ledgers=true`)
        - Balance information: Current available amount (if `include_balance=true`)
        - Rollover settings: Fraction of unused amount that carries forward

        ### Usage guidelines:

        - Pagination: Results limited to 25 commits per page; use 'next_page' for more
        - Date filtering options:
          - `covering_date`: Commits active on a specific date
          - `starting_at`: Commits with access on/after a date
          - `effective_before`: Commits with access before a date (exclusive)

          - `include_contract_commits`: Include contract-level commits (not just
            customer-level)
          - `include_archived`: Include archived commits and commits from archived
            contracts
        - Performance considerations:
          - include_ledgers: Adds detailed transaction history (slower)
          - include_balance: Adds current balance calculation (slower)
        - Optional filtering: Use commit_id to retrieve a specific commit
