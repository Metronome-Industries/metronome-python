        Retrieve detailed information for a specific invoice by its unique identifier.
        This endpoint returns comprehensive invoice data including line items, applied
        credits, totals, and billing period details for both finalized and draft
        invoices.

        ### Use this endpoint to:

        - Display historical invoice details in customer-facing dashboards or billing
          portals.
        - Retrieve current month draft invoices to show customers their month-to-date
          spend.
        - Access finalized invoices for historical billing records and payment
          reconciliation.
        - Validate customer pricing and credit applications for customer support
          queries.

        ### Key response fields:

        Invoice status (DRAFT, FINALIZED, VOID) Billing period start and end dates Total
        amount and amount due after credits Detailed line items broken down by:

        - Customer and contract information
        - Invoice line item type
        - Product/service name and ID
        - Quantity consumed
        - Unit and total price
        - Time period for usage-based charges
        - Applied credits or prepaid commitments

        ### Usage guidelines:

        - Draft invoices update in real-time as usage is reported and may change before
          finalization
        - The response includes both usage-based line items (e.g., API calls, data
          processed) and scheduled charges (e.g., monthly subscriptions, commitment
          fees)
        - Credit and commitment applications are shown as separate line items with
          negative amounts
        - For voided invoices, the response will indicate VOID status but retain all
          original line item details

        Retrieves a paginated list of invoices for a specific customer, with flexible
        filtering options to narrow results by status, date range, credit type, and
        more. This endpoint provides a comprehensive view of a customer's billing
        history and current charges, supporting both real-time billing dashboards and
        historical reporting needs.

        ### Use this endpoint to:

        - Display historical invoice details in customer-facing dashboards or billing
          portals.
        - Retrieve current month draft invoices to show customers their month-to-date

        - Validate customer pricing and credit applications for customer support
          queries.
        - Generate financial reports by filtering invoices within specific date ranges

        ### Key response fields:

        Array of invoice objects containing:

        - Invoice ID and status (DRAFT, FINALIZED, VOID)
        - Invoice type (USAGE, SCHEDULED)
        - Billing period start and end dates

        - Contract ID reference
        - External billing provider status (if integrated with Stripe, etc.)
        - Pagination metadata `next_page` cursor

        ### Usage guidelines:

        - The endpoint returns invoice summaries; use the Get Invoice endpoint for
          detailed line items
        - Draft invoices are continuously updated as new usage is reported and will show
          real-time spend
        - Results are ordered by creation date descending by default (newest first)
        - When filtering by date range, the filter applies to the billing period, not
          the issue date
        - For customers with many invoices, implement pagination to ensure all results
          are retrieved External billing provider statuses (like Stripe payment status)
          are included when applicable
        - Voided invoices are included in results by default unless filtered out by
          status

        Args:
          credit_type_id: Only return invoices for the specified credit type

          ending_before: RFC 3339 timestamp (exclusive). Invoices will only be returned for billing
              periods that end before this time.

          limit: Max number of results that should be returned

          next_page: Cursor that indicates where the next page of results should start.

          skip_zero_qty_line_items: If set, all zero quantity line items will be filtered out of the response

        Retrieve granular time-series breakdowns of invoice data at hourly or daily
        intervals. This endpoint transforms standard invoices into detailed timelines,
        enabling you to track usage patterns, identify consumption spikes, and provide
        customers with transparency into their billing details throughout the billing
        period.

        ### Use this endpoint to:

        - Build usage analytics dashboards showing daily or hourly consumption trends
        - Identify peak usage periods for capacity planning and cost optimization
        - Generate detailed billing reports for finance teams and customer success
        - Troubleshoot billing disputes by examining usage patterns at specific times
        - Power real-time cost monitoring and alerting systems

        ### Key response fields:

        An array of BreakdownInvoice objects, each containing:

        - All standard invoice fields (ID, customer, commit, line items, totals, status)
        - Line items with quantities and costs for that specific period
        - `breakdown_start_timestamp`: Start of the specific time window
        - `breakdown_end_timestamp`: End of the specific time window
        - `next_page`: Pagination cursor for large result sets

        ### Usage guidelines:

        - Time granularity: Set `window_size` to hour or day based on your analysis
          needs
        - Response limits: Daily breakdowns return up to 35 days; hourly breakdowns
          return up to 24 hours per request
        - Date filtering: Use `starting_on` and `ending_before` to focus on specific
          periods
        - Performance: For large date ranges, use pagination to retrieve all data
          efficiently
        - Backdated usage: If usage events arrive after invoice finalization, breakdowns
          will reflect the updated usage
        - Zero quantity filtering: Use `skip_zero_qty_line_items=true` to exclude
          periods with no usage

        Args:
          ending_before: RFC 3339 timestamp. Breakdowns will only be returned for time windows that end
              on or before this time.

          starting_on: RFC 3339 timestamp. Breakdowns will only be returned for time windows that start
              on or after this time.

          credit_type_id: Only return invoices for the specified credit type

          limit: Max number of results that should be returned. For daily breakdowns, the
              response can return up to 35 days worth of breakdowns. For hourly breakdowns,
              the response can return up to 24 hours. If there are more results, a cursor to
              the next page is returned.

          next_page: Cursor that indicates where the next page of results should start.

          skip_zero_qty_line_items: If set, all zero quantity line items will be filtered out of the response

          sort: Invoice sort order by issued_at, e.g. date_asc or date_desc. Defaults to
              date_asc.

          status: Invoice status, e.g. DRAFT or FINALIZED

          window_size: The granularity of the breakdowns to return. Defaults to day.

        Retrieve detailed information for a specific invoice by its unique identifier.
        This endpoint returns comprehensive invoice data including line items, applied
        credits, totals, and billing period details for both finalized and draft
        invoices.

        ### Use this endpoint to:

        - Display historical invoice details in customer-facing dashboards or billing
          portals.
        - Retrieve current month draft invoices to show customers their month-to-date
          spend.
        - Access finalized invoices for historical billing records and payment
          reconciliation.
        - Validate customer pricing and credit applications for customer support
          queries.

        ### Key response fields:

        Invoice status (DRAFT, FINALIZED, VOID) Billing period start and end dates Total
        amount and amount due after credits Detailed line items broken down by:

        - Customer and contract information
        - Invoice line item type
        - Product/service name and ID
        - Quantity consumed
        - Unit and total price
        - Time period for usage-based charges
        - Applied credits or prepaid commitments

        ### Usage guidelines:

        - Draft invoices update in real-time as usage is reported and may change before
          finalization
        - The response includes both usage-based line items (e.g., API calls, data
          processed) and scheduled charges (e.g., monthly subscriptions, commitment
          fees)
        - Credit and commitment applications are shown as separate line items with
          negative amounts
        - For voided invoices, the response will indicate VOID status but retain all
          original line item details

        Retrieves a paginated list of invoices for a specific customer, with flexible
        filtering options to narrow results by status, date range, credit type, and
        more. This endpoint provides a comprehensive view of a customer's billing
        history and current charges, supporting both real-time billing dashboards and
        historical reporting needs.

        ### Use this endpoint to:

        - Display historical invoice details in customer-facing dashboards or billing
          portals.
        - Retrieve current month draft invoices to show customers their month-to-date
          spend.

          reconciliation.
        - Validate customer pricing and credit applications for customer support
          queries.
        - Generate financial reports by filtering invoices within specific date ranges

        ### Key response fields:

        Array of invoice objects containing:

        - Invoice ID and status (DRAFT, FINALIZED, VOID)
        - Invoice type (USAGE, SCHEDULED)
        - Billing period start and end dates
        - Issue date and due date

        - Contract ID reference
        - External billing provider status (if integrated with Stripe, etc.)
        - Pagination metadata `next_page` cursor

        ### Usage guidelines:

        - The endpoint returns invoice summaries; use the Get Invoice endpoint for
          detailed line items
        - Draft invoices are continuously updated as new usage is reported and will show
          real-time spend
        - Results are ordered by creation date descending by default (newest first)
        - When filtering by date range, the filter applies to the billing period, not
          the issue date
        - For customers with many invoices, implement pagination to ensure all results
          are retrieved External billing provider statuses (like Stripe payment status)
          are included when applicable
        - Voided invoices are included in results by default unless filtered out by
          status

        Args:
          credit_type_id: Only return invoices for the specified credit type

          ending_before: RFC 3339 timestamp (exclusive). Invoices will only be returned for billing
              periods that end before this time.

          limit: Max number of results that should be returned

          next_page: Cursor that indicates where the next page of results should start.

          skip_zero_qty_line_items: If set, all zero quantity line items will be filtered out of the response

        Retrieve granular time-series breakdowns of invoice data at hourly or daily
        intervals. This endpoint transforms standard invoices into detailed timelines,
        enabling you to track usage patterns, identify consumption spikes, and provide
        customers with transparency into their billing details throughout the billing
        period.

        ### Use this endpoint to:

        - Build usage analytics dashboards showing daily or hourly consumption trends
        - Identify peak usage periods for capacity planning and cost optimization
        - Generate detailed billing reports for finance teams and customer success
        - Troubleshoot billing disputes by examining usage patterns at specific times
        - Power real-time cost monitoring and alerting systems

        ### Key response fields:

        An array of BreakdownInvoice objects, each containing:

        - All standard invoice fields (ID, customer, commit, line items, totals, status)
        - Line items with quantities and costs for that specific period
        - `breakdown_start_timestamp`: Start of the specific time window
        - `breakdown_end_timestamp`: End of the specific time window
        - `next_page`: Pagination cursor for large result sets

        ### Usage guidelines:

        - Time granularity: Set `window_size` to hour or day based on your analysis
          needs
        - Response limits: Daily breakdowns return up to 35 days; hourly breakdowns
          return up to 24 hours per request
        - Date filtering: Use `starting_on` and `ending_before` to focus on specific
          periods
        - Performance: For large date ranges, use pagination to retrieve all data
          efficiently
        - Backdated usage: If usage events arrive after invoice finalization, breakdowns
          will reflect the updated usage
        - Zero quantity filtering: Use `skip_zero_qty_line_items=true` to exclude
          periods with no usage

        Args:
          ending_before: RFC 3339 timestamp. Breakdowns will only be returned for time windows that end

          starting_on: RFC 3339 timestamp. Breakdowns will only be returned for time windows that start
              on or after this time.

          credit_type_id: Only return invoices for the specified credit type

          limit: Max number of results that should be returned. For daily breakdowns, the
              response can return up to 35 days worth of breakdowns. For hourly breakdowns,
              the response can return up to 24 hours. If there are more results, a cursor to
              the next page is returned.

          next_page: Cursor that indicates where the next page of results should start.

          skip_zero_qty_line_items: If set, all zero quantity line items will be filtered out of the response

          sort: Invoice sort order by issued_at, e.g. date_asc or date_desc. Defaults to
              date_asc.

          status: Invoice status, e.g. DRAFT or FINALIZED

          window_size: The granularity of the breakdowns to return. Defaults to day.
